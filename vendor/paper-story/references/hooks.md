# Hooks: the first two seconds

This list grows. A daily routine researches new hook patterns and adds the ones that are genuinely new (see the log
at the end); add your own whenever a film teaches you one.

Most viewers decide in the first 1 to 2 seconds whether to keep watching. Every film starts with a hook. Never pick
one on the user's behalf: read the story, choose 3 or 4 hook types from this list that the story can honestly
support, write each one out (spoken line, on-screen text, first frame), recommend one, and let the user choose.

## Rules for any hook

- **The first frame already moves and already says something.** No fade from black, no empty title card. The text on
  screen in frame 1 is the hook itself (it doubles as the thumbnail and works with the sound off).
- **The film pays it off.** A question gets answered, a number gets explained, a teased moment arrives. A hook the
  film does not deliver is clickbait and costs trust.
- **True, and sourced like the rest of the film.** No invented rivalry, no "nobody knows this" unless it is genuinely
  little-known, no number that is not in the facts file.
- **Short.** Spoken: 6 to 14 words. On screen: 3 to 7 words.
- **Name what the audience already knows** (the product, the icon) within the first 2 seconds; the unknown
  (the founder, the backstory) can follow.
- **Brands:** a hook may not add a name or logo the brand rules do not allow.
- **Every part of a series opens on its own hook.** A part that opened straight into the story ("انتهى الرسم في
  ليلة") had none, and that was the note. A "Part 2" title is not a hook.
- **When the spoken line does not name the icon, frame 1 does:** the icon's photo with its label, or a small series
  line under the hook text («الرويال أوك · الجزء الثاني»).
- **The user's wording wins.** If they rewrite a hook past 14 words, say what it costs in seconds once, then build
  theirs. Check its grammar (agreement: «هدّدت ساعاتُ الكوارتز», not «هدّد الكوارتز» for the watches) and that it
  states the source's relation (context, not cause: «وراهنت», not «فراهنت», unless the source says so).
- **Listen to it before building on it.** A term sent to the voice in Latin letters loses its Arabic article: the
  hook said «هدّد كوارتز». Run `scripts/voice-check.py` on every new hook line (see production.md, Voice).

## The types

| # | Type | What it does | Pattern | Best first frame |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Paradox | Two facts that should not fit together | "A steel watch that cost more than gold." | The two things side by side |
| 2 | Curiosity question | A question the viewer cannot answer yet | "Why would anyone pay more for steel?" | The object, close, slowly turning |
| 3 | Shock number | One surprising, true figure | "One night. One drawing. Fifty years of icon." | The number, big, on the object |
| 4 | Cold open (in medias res) | Starts at the most dramatic moment, then rewinds | "4 pm, 10 April 1970. The phone rings." | The moment itself (ringing phone, clock) |
| 5 | Ticking clock | A deadline the hero must beat | "He had until tomorrow morning." | A clock, a blank page |
| 6 | Stakes / threat | What could be lost | "In 1970 the mechanical watch was about to die." | The threat (the rival product) |
| 7 | Flash-forward | Shows the famous ending first, then asks how | "You know this watch. You don't know this night." | The finished icon, then the person |
| 8 | Myth-buster | Corrects a story people repeat | "They say it flopped. It didn't." | The myth as a stamp, then crossed out |
| 9 | Recognition | Something the viewer has surely seen | "You've seen this octagon everywhere." | The shape, filling the frame |
| 10 | Underdog | The odds were against the hero | "Everyone said steel can't be luxury." | The doubters, then the hero |
| 11 | Secret detail | A detail most people miss | "Look at the screws. They're not there to hold it." | Macro of the detail |
| 12 | Promise | Tells the viewer what they will get | "In 60 seconds: how one call created an icon." | The icon with a timer |
| 13 | Open loop | Starts a story and promises its end later | "By the end you'll know why this watch has eight screws." | The detail, then cut away |
| 14 | Pattern interrupt | Frame 1 is unexpected in look or sound | (a hard sound, a torn page, a sudden zoom) then the line | Something the feed has not shown |
| 15 | Before and after | Shows the change in one cut | "1969: gold. 1972: steel, and dearer." | The two states, wiped |
| 16 | Versus | Two rivals, one winner the film reveals | "Quartz against steel. Only one survived." | Both, face to face |
| 17 | Identity call-out | Speaks to who the viewer is | "If you own a steel sports watch, this is its origin." | The viewer's object |
| 18 | Insider view | The teller's own expertise | "As watch dealers, this is the story we tell first." | The shop, the hands |
| 19 | List tease | Numbers the payoff | "Three things nobody tells you about the Royal Oak." | "3" on screen |
| 20 | Sensory detail | A sound or texture to lean in to | (the click of a crown, a pencil on paper) | Macro, sound up |
| 21 | Contrarian | Disagrees with a common belief | "The best watch design took one night, not one year." | The claim as a stamp |

## How to present the choice

For each part, give 3 or 4 options built from the story's own facts:

- **Type**, and why it fits this story.
- **Spoken line** in the film's language and dialect.
- **On-screen text** in frame 1.
- **First visual** (which real photo or scene).
- **Cost:** a new voice line (credits) or picture only.

Mark the one you recommend and say why in one line. When the user has chosen, build that hook. Then check that the
film pays it off and that frame 1 works as a still.

## Log

Every film records which hook it used, so the same type is not used twice in a row. The daily research adds new
types here with the date and where the idea came from.

| Date | Film | Hook used / added | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-10-05 | Royal Oak, Part 1 | Used #2 curiosity question | "كيف شاب عمره ثلاثة وعشرين… صار ورا أشهر ساعات العالم؟" over the 23-year-old at his board |
| 2026-10-05 | Royal Oak, Part 2 | Used #6 stakes | "سنة سبعين… الكوارتز جاي ياخذ كل شي" over the real Seiko Quartz Astron |
| 2026-10-05 | (library) | Added #13 to #21 | From experience on this project |
| 2026-10-12 | Royal Oak, Part 1 (v17) | Used #7 flash-forward (replaces #2) | "تعرفون الرويال أوك… لكن هل تعرفون الرجل الذي رسمها؟" over the Royal Oak from frame 1, then the unnamed young Genta. The question hook named the icon only at second 3 and the owner found it weak |
| 2026-10-12 | Royal Oak, Part 2 (v19) | Used #6 stakes, sharper | "عام سبعين، هدّد الكوارتز الساعة الميكانيكية… وراهنت أوديمار بيغيه على الستيل." On screen «الكوارتز قادم… والرهان: الستيل» plus the series name, so the icon is named in frame 1 |
| 2026-10-12 | Royal Oak, Part 2 (v20) | #6 stakes, owner's wording | "عام سبعين، هدّدت ساعاتُ الكوارتز الساعاتِ الميكانيكية… وراهنت أوديمار بيغيه على ساعةٍ من الستيل بتشطيبٍ فاخر." Lesson: a term sent to the voice in Latin loses the Arabic article («هدّد كوارتز»); where the article matters, keep the word Arabic (script `_arabic`) and check the clip with a transcript before rendering. 10.5 s, longer than the usual hook, by the owner's choice |
| 2026-10-12 | Royal Oak, Part 3 (v18) | Used #1 paradox | "ساعةٌ من الستيل… بسعرٍ أعلى من ساعاتٍ كثيرة من الذهب. كيف؟" Steel and gold prints side by side, the steel one rises like a scale; the price scene pays it off. A part without a hook is the first thing to fix |
