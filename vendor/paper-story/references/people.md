# Real people: cut-outs and generated poses

For a film about real people (founders, a team), the figures are their own photos cut out with a paper border, not the
mascot. These rules come from making the Time Keeper success story (`video/success-story/story.py`), and every one of
them was a note from the people in it.

## Who is who

- The user labels each photo. Never identify a person by their face, and never guess who is who from a group photo.
- Keep one cut-out per person per outfit (`assets/figures/<person>_<outfit>.png`), git-ignored with the rest of the
  personal media.
- Relative heights come from a real group photo, as a factor per person (`HEIGHT = {...}` in story.py). Scale every
  shot by it so people never swap heights between scenes.
- Check proportions: an adult stands about 7 heads tall. Photos shot from above give big heads and short legs. The
  people called it looking like dwarfs. Fix it geometrically and leave the face alone: stretch only a plain band of
  clothing (a dishdasha between the hands and the shoes) until the figure is about 7 heads tall. Keep the face and
  shoes as they are (see the `-tall` cut-outs in `video/success-story/simple.py`).
- Show each person through what they do, never with a name or title on screen. Give each one a role the user has
  confirmed (in the story: one on camera, one researching and writing, one designing watches). Show the role as the
  person describes it. "Design" meant designing watches, so the designer holds a pencil drawing of a watch, not a logo.
  Make sure the role is clear and specific. Bring a person in only when the
  story gives them a part.

## Poses a photo cannot do: generate stills, not video

A standing photo cannot shake hands, sit or talk into a mic. Make new still images of the same people with an image
model that takes reference images (Higgsfield `nano_banana_2`, role `image_references`, 1.5 credits each, worked well),
then cut them out and animate them in the engine like any cut-out. Do not use video generation for this.

1. Upload each person's cut-out once and keep the media ids.
2. Make one image first and check the faces before making the rest.
3. Submit the rest as one batch. Review them on one contact sheet, cropping close on each face.
4. Cut them out with `scripts/cut-poses.py <folder>`. It removes the flat grey backdrop, including grey pockets
   between arms, legs and chair rungs. Check the result on a green sheet: leftover grey is easy to see there.

Prompt shape that worked:

> The three exact men from the reference images, same faces, glasses, hair and beards, same outfits as their
> references (spell each outfit out). [Pose, and who stands LEFT / MIDDLE / RIGHT.] Full body head to shoes, all fully
> inside the frame with margins. Photographic cut-out sticker look like the references: real photo people with a thin
> cream paper border around the silhouettes. Plain flat light grey background, no scenery, no text.

Notes from the reviews:

- **Say who stands where, then check it.** One image paired the wrong two people for the scene. Compare each image
  against the story order before using it.
- **Ask for margins.** A group sitting on cushions came back cropped at the edges. Regenerate rather than patch it.
- **Tone follows the brand.** For a luxury brand, people must look composed: calm faces, subtle dignified smiles,
  measured gestures, upright posture. Excited open-mouthed expressions read as shouting and were rejected. Write
  "no shouting, no wide open mouths, no exaggerated expressions" into the prompt.
- **Never AI-edit a face or build.** An edit to make one person slimmer changed his face, and the user wanted the
  original back. To adjust a build, narrow the cut-out geometrically (`aspect` times 0.93 or so) and leave the face
  alone. Keep the originals whenever you edit, so you can restore them.
- **Hero products are always real photos.** Never generate the product the story is about (here, watches). Prompt for
  empty hands, an open empty palm, an empty tabletop or a blank sheet. Then composite the real product photo onto it in
  the storyboard. The small watches that come on the wrists in a generated image are the only exception.

## Putting a pose in a scene

- A `pose()` helper is a `cutout` sized by height on screen. Its `in`/`out` times let it swap with the single figures
  in the same spot. The figures walk in, then cross-fade (0.2 s) into the pose: two people walk up, then they shake
  hands. See `pose()` and `gone()` in story.py.
- A generated pose holding a blank sheet can carry a drawing. Warp it onto the sheet's four corners and multiply it in,
  so it reads as pencil on that paper (`video/success-story/sketch_pose.py`).
- Measure positions on the cut-out, not by eye. Draw a 100 px grid over it, read off the palm or tabletop, and
  convert to stage coordinates (`dx`, `dy`, `TOP` in story.py).
- Size a product against the hands, but big enough to read on a phone. Watches shrunk to hand scale were called too
  small; about 1.5 hand lengths for a watch on a table was right.
- A waist-up crop of a group can sit on the bottom edge of the frame, with nothing below it.

## Historical figures and real products the user has no photos of

People want the real person and the real product: a cut-out of their actual photograph gives a story far more depth
than a silhouette (a note on the Royal Oak story). So find a photograph you may use before drawing a stand-in:

- Search Wikimedia Commons (the person's Wikipedia infobox image is usually there) and check each file's licence and
  author with the API (`prop=imageinfo&iiprop=extmetadata`). Send a descriptive User-Agent and fetch the `thumb/`
  sizes if the originals answer 429.
- Cut people and products out with Higgsfield `remove_background` (upload, confirm, remove, download). Firm a soft
  alpha into a clean paper edge with a threshold and a small median filter, and crop where the photo goes vague.
- Credit every photograph on screen (author, licence, "via Wikimedia Commons") and in the project's notes.
- Say what the picture really is. A later portrait is fine for a person, but note its date. A product photo of a
  related model gets a small label in the scene ("pictured: ref. 15202, the 5402's successor").
- Paper characters of a historical figure (when the user asks for them): generate paper-craft illustrations, not
  photo-real images, with a freely licensed portrait as the face reference. Test one image in two versions where it
  matters (as in the photo, or at the story's age) and let the user pick; ageing a face up or down is the model's
  guess, so the photo's age keeps the likeness. Then batch the poses the story needs (on the phone, thinking, at the
  drafting table, holding a blank sheet, presenting with an empty palm) using the approved image as a second
  reference. Credit them on screen as AI illustrations.
- Someone with no usable photograph gets no invented face: a detailed paper character seen from behind or from the
  side (`video/royal-oak/`: Golay at his desk, from behind). Never a black silhouette standing in for a character:
  the user asked for people with detail and personality, so give them clothes, hair, posture and a prop that says who
  they are.
- **Everyone the narration counts is on screen.** "Three agents" with two photos read as two (the owner's note on
  Part 2). When a named person has no documented photograph, give them a print the same size as the others with
  the engine's silhouette in it (`"silhouette": true` on a polaroid `image`, or a note text instead of `true`): a
  plain grey head and shoulders and «لا توجد صورة موثّقة», labelled with their name. A typed name card next to two
  photographs did not read as a person.
- Generated backdrops often carry a gradient; cut them with Higgsfield `remove_background` rather than `cut-poses.py`.

## Real products on screen (notes from the Royal Oak story)

- **Show the whole photograph in a taped polaroid, never a cut-out of the product.** Background removal clipped
  straps and bracelets, and the user called the cut watches wrong. A polaroid with `aspect` set to the photo's own
  ratio shows every pixel; a hero shot can also be a full-screen `macro()` with a slow push.
- **Open every file and check what it shows before using it.** Archive filenames lie: a "sketch" was the real
  catalogue photo, a "bezel" was a bracelet, two files were the same drawing turned 90°. Draw a 5 % grid over a
  photo to measure where things are (a case's flanks for a dimension line, a dial for a pencil circle).
- **Label what the picture is, not what the story is about.** No year a photo cannot prove ("Polerouter", not
  "Polerouter · 1954" on a later dial). A product from before the hero's work says so ("before his refresh") and stays
  out of a gallery of his designs. Collectors say "Ref.", not "model". A related model gets its own reference number.
- **Put people only where the record puts them.** The designer was at the 1972 fair but on his own stand; showing
  him at the brand's stand was the historian's first note.
- **Real details beat drawn ones.** When the story names a feature (eight screws, a tapering bracelet, the thinness),
  pin the archive photo or document that shows it (a case sheet, the first trade publication, an exploded case).
  A drawn version of the hero product appears only as the designer's sketch, and it must still be right: crown and
  date where they are, proportions from the technical sheet.
- **Gallery of a career:** a cork board with pinned prints in date order and a red thread reads as "sixteen years of
  work"; a scatter of polaroids that pop and vanish does not.

## Archive photographs of people (notes from the Royal Oak story)

- **Crop to the face, then look at the crop at full size.** A group photo cropped to "the man on the right" cut him
  at the nose; the owner saw only his ear and glasses. Keep the whole face, glasses, nose and mouth; widen the crop
  rather than lose the profile. Render a still at the final scale (`--still t --scale 1.5`) and look at every person.
- **A neighbour at the edge of a crop:** darken that edge with a soft gradient so the subject reads as the subject;
  never touch the subject (`video/royal-oak/crops.py`, `bauty1976_face`). Make crops in a script so they can be rebuilt.
- **Every archive portrait carries its year** in the label ("شارل بوتي، باريس 1976"), so no photo reads as taken at the
  meeting the story is about. A photo that does not say who is who is labelled with both names, not guessed.
- **Resolution:** `--check` notes any picture shown more than 1.5x bigger than its file. A face that soft looks
  wrong on a phone: find a bigger scan, or show it smaller. Never AI-upscale or retouch a real person's face.
