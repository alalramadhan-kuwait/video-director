# Production notes: camera, sound, review and delivery

These notes come from the Time Keeper success story (`video/success-story/`, 21 scenes, 2 minutes, 14 versions) and the
three-part Royal Oak documentary (`video/royal-oak/parts.py`, Arabic, many review rounds with the owner).

## Keep it moving

- Change something visible every 2 to 3 seconds: a camera move, a layer arriving, a cut to a close-up. A scene that
  holds like a poster was the most common note.
- Give every scene a `camera` and lay its layers out at different `depth`s. A wide set can be wider than 720; pan
  across it in time with the narration (a podcast set: writer, then designer, then host).
- Full-screen close-ups cropped from real product photos (`macro()` in story.py, `fit: cover`, a slow scale push)
  cut between the wider shots.

## Motion that answered "it needs more movement" (Royal Oak expert review)

These are cheap and cover every scene; `life()` in `video/royal-oak/parts.py` applies the first two automatically.

- **People breathe:** `idle: "breathe"` (0.6 % over 4 s, from the feet). Nobody stands frozen, and nobody trembles:
  photos and cut-outs never take the line boil (Étienne's review of Halter: every element jittered ±0.7 px 12 times a
  second and the posters "trembled on an empty page").
- **Taped prints settle:** a 1 to 1.5 degree `rot` drift and a 0.6 % `scale` creep over the time they are on screen.
- **No camera hold longer than about 2 s:** keep a 3 to 5 % drift between beats and add a small push on each beat.
  The studio enforces it (`director/studio/motion.py`): every scene's camera moves at least 3 % (push, pull, drift or
  lateral dolly, seeded per scene), is still moving at the cut, and a scene longer than 5 s punches in on a word
  half-way. The quality step and the review flag a scene that moves less (LONG_HOLD).
- **Layers at different `depth`:** background .4 to .7, pinned things .85 to .9, the subject 1, foreground 1.1 to 1.3.
- **Light has life:** dust motes in every spotlight (`motes()`), one glint sweep across a hero product photo
  (`glint()`), a lamp whose glow breathes.
- **Things that move in the story move on screen:** the tandem rides, its wheels turn (use `rot` keyframes with an
  ease, not a spin idle, so they slow down) and it brakes on the line where the partners stop; the phone handset
  lifts and the ringing stops.
- **Beats land on words.** Time each visual to the caption word it illustrates. `at(key, caption, phrase)` in
  parts.py computes that time the way the engine spreads the words.
- **Matched cuts instead of slides:** the same calendar in the same place across a cut, the porthole that becomes the
  pencil circle at the same screen size, a fade for a jump in time. No more than two slides in a row.
- **Endings:** a slow push through the last line, then dim everything except the hero (a black plate under it).

## The look (Royal Oak art direction)

- **Everyone stands on something:** a soft contact shadow under each figure and a floor band in empty scenes.
- **One key light** from the upper left for every drop shadow (`SHADOW` in art.py), deeper on dark themes.
- **One palette arc per film**, not a new theme every scene. Light and time of day stay continuous (the same 4 pm in
  both parts of the call).
- **Rooms, not voids:** a studio gets a window, a board and tools; a fair gets bunting, lamps, a banner and a carpet.
  Use the country's colours (Swiss red and white, not French tricolour bunting).
- **Consistent scale:** one height per character pose across the film, so a partner never looks like a child.
- **Covers:** titles sit on a paper band; nothing crosses the title; the person is fully in frame.

## Camera arithmetic (check every keyframe, not just the scene start)

The stage point `y` appears on screen at `640 + (y - camY) * zoom` (the same formula with 360 for `x`).

- **Nothing ever covers a face**: not the banner, a card, a speech bubble or a picture. This was raised twice, so it is
  checked mechanically: `render.mjs story.json --check`. It also flags bubbles and words hidden under the banner. A
  bubble goes between the banner and the heads; when there is no room, lower the camera rather than shrink the bubble.
- **The banner covers the top of the screen** (about y 60 to 160). Every head must stay below about y 190 at every
  camera keyframe. A head under the 2019 banner was a review note.
- Props that stand in front of people must not cross a face: ring lights, mics, stands.
- The person who matters in a shot is big and close. A host who was small and far from the mic was a note. Move the
  pose, scale it up and push the camera in on them at the end of the scene.

## Voice

- Make one clip per line (`voice` per scene, scene length follows the clip), all in the same voice.
- When a line is re-recorded, level it to the others by mean volume before use (`video/success-story/voice/cut-andre.py`).
- The script stays in the user's dialect and wording; send the full script for review before rendering.
- **Names and terms in Latin letters, the article in Arabic.** Sending a foreign name to the voice in Latin letters
  (a pronunciation map, `tts_habibi.PRON` in the Royal Oak project) fixes how it is said, but an Arabic article in
  front of it is lost: «الكوارتز» → "Quartz" was heard as «هدّد كوارتز», «من الستيل» as «من ستيل». Where the article
  matters, keep that word Arabic for that line (the script's `_arabic: {line: [words]}` in `tts_eleven.py`), and
  check the result.
- **Check every new clip before rendering:** `scripts/voice-check.py voice/clips.json [lines] --terms الكوارتز,الستيل`
  transcribes on this machine (free, faster-whisper) and lists written words that were not heard and terms said
  without their article. Then `scripts/audio-check.py voice/clips/*.wav` for clicks, cuts, clipping and words cut at
  the edge of a clip. Report both to the user in one line; a clip that fails is fixed before any render.
- **A free draft read comes first.** `scripts/draft-voice.py script.json` reads every changed line with a free
  voice (gTTS, no key, no credits) into `voice-draft/` and one `read-<part>.mp3` per part. The user reviews the
  wording by ear (a wrong word such as «أشهر» meaning "months", a sentence too long for its scene) before a single
  paid character is spent. It reads names the Arabic way; how the paid voice says them is checked after recording.
  Microsoft's free Edge voices were refused (403) from the cloud environment; gTTS works through the proxy.
- **Paid voices:** record nothing until the user approves the exact text, voice, model and settings, and say the
  cost first (characters). Record only the lines that changed, keep the previous take (`prev/`), and run one TTS
  process at a time. With ElevenLabs behind the agent proxy the key is injected as the `xi-api-key` header on `/v1`
  paths only; never ask for the key in chat.

## Music under narration (`video/success-story/mix-music.py`)

- Render with the music muted (`MUSIC_GAIN=-90`), then lay the music in a second pass. A re-mix then takes seconds,
  not a re-render.
- Land the music's drop on the key scene. Repeat whole bars of the build-up to push the drop later, and pad the scene
  before it so that scene starts exactly on a bar. story.py computes the bars to insert and writes them to the
  storyboard (`musicInsertBars`); the mixer reads them.
- Duck the music under the voice: sidechain-compress it, keyed by the voice clips themselves. Normalise the result to
  -14 LUFS for social.
- **Levels that were measured to work** (Étienne's Halter review; `director/studio/mix.py` sets them): the music
  about 18-20 dB under the voice while it speaks and about 10 dB under it in the gaps (music gain -6 dB, duck ratio 3,
  threshold 0.03, release 400 ms; at -18 dB and ratio 6 it was 40 dB under and the film went silent between
  sentences); a bed in every scene with a world or a mood, 24-28 dB under the voice, starting 0.5 s before its cut;
  one-shots 3-6 dB under the voice, at most 15 a minute, and paper sounds only when paper really comes in.

## Arabic captions and on-screen text

- **Groups of three words or fewer.** The engine splits a longer `|` group after word three and leaves orphans. Never
  split a number ("سبعة | وستين"), a negation from its verb ("ما | يكفي") or a noun phrase.
- **Western digits (0-9) everywhere.** A "·" next to an Arabic-Indic digit reads as a zero ("١٠ ·" looked like
  "١٠٠"). No dash between two numbers in Arabic: write "10 على 11".
- **Keep the caption band clear** (about y 960 to 1070 at the end camera): no label, price tag or credit there while
  captions are on. `--check` does not catch this; look at the stills.
- **Tags add, they do not repeat.** A tag that says the same words as the caption at the same moment is noise.
  Keep dates, places, quotes set as titles. Quote marks are «».
- **Arabic in a `sketch` text writes itself left to right.** Keep sketch notes in the designer's own language (French
  on a Swiss drawing) and put the Arabic in a tag.
- **Credits:** at least 17 px, light on dark, after the punchline, never under the platform overlay at the bottom.
- **Dialect:** write how people speak, and ask about words that change meaning ("انشغلت" means "got busy" in the
  Gulf, not "was crafted").

## Expert review round

When the user asks for more detail or a second opinion, run a panel of reviewers in parallel, each with the same
pack: the rules, the engine's abilities, a frame strip per scene and the narration with its timings. Panels that
worked: motion director, art director, historian / fact-checker, readability and dialect editor, and an expert in
the product (a watch collector). Ask each for P1/P2/P3 notes with exact coordinates and times. Then merge them into
one plan ordered by priority, apply what needs no credits, list what does, and re-render.

## Facts

- Every claim in the film is in the facts file with its source, and so is every picture's credit.
- **Context is not cause.** The quartz crisis was the backdrop to the decision, not the reason given for the design;
  say it the way the source does.
- Keep the source's hedges ("probably designed by him") and its caveats (a date the subject remembered).

## When voice credits run short

Preflight each line (`get_cost`; about 0.3 credits for a short line, 0.6 for a long one). If the balance does not
cover it, build the scene anyway: give `clips.json` an estimated length (characters ÷ about 11 per second), let the
captions play over the music, and list the line in a `VOICE-TODO.md` with its new text. Record and drop it in when the
user tops up.

## Review loop

- Before a full render, render stills at the exact seconds that changed (`--still t1,t2,...`). Read them as one sheet.
  Compute the times from the scene durations rather than guessing.
- When the user sends a screenshot, first check which version it came from. Two notes were about an older version
  than the one already rendering.
- The renderer reads images while it renders. Never swap or edit assets during a render: stop it and start again,
  or the film mixes old and new. (It now waits for every image to decode before the first frame; before that, large
  cut-outs were missing from the opening frames.)
- Name each render with a new version number. Delete partial renders so an old file is never sent by mistake.
- **`--check` before every render, on every part.** Besides faces it now lists anything cut by the frame, a print over
  another print or over its label, a print, tag or small drawing on the captions, and pictures shown bigger than
  their file. On the Royal Oak films it found faults in a part that had already passed review by eye (a tag under the
  captions, a document over the hero's label, team prints hiding each other's names). Fix until it is clean; mark
  the deliberate exceptions (`stack`, `crop`, `underCaptions`) rather than ignoring the output.
- **Look at every person at full size** (`--still t --scale 1.5`), not on a contact sheet: a crop that showed only an
  ear and glasses looked fine at thumbnail size.
- **Check the final mix:** `scripts/audio-check.py film.mp4` (clipping on each channel, gaps, clicks in silence,
  loudness and true peak).
- **A note about one scene is a note about every scene like it.** "This print is cut off" meant: check all of them.
  Run the check over all parts and fix the whole class, then say what else was found.

## Prints on screen

- Prints are at least 280 px wide on a 720 px frame. When three or more must share the frame (three agents), 250 px
  each (`small=True` in parts.py), two above and one centred below, so no print covers another's label.
- Tags and labels never sit on a photograph or on the caption band; a tag belongs next to what it names (a year
  above the tree, not under the captions).
- The tape on an inset map must not hide a pin's label; put a crowded pin's label on its other side (`left: true`).
- A document that shares the stage with the hero appears while the hero is hidden (behind the drape) and leaves at
  the reveal, rather than covering the hero's label.

## A film in several parts

- Each part opens on its own hook, ends on "يتبع…" with the next part's title, and has its own cover.
- Adding or removing a scene shifts everything indexed by scene: the score's mood list (`score_parts.py` gives
  moods by scene index; add one for a new opening scene), the stills you check, and the times in your notes.
- Once a part is published, every later fix to it is a new version the user must choose to re-upload: say which
  fixes are in it and keep the published file's version number in the message.

## Pipeline gotchas

- The mix and delivery scripts need ffmpeg: set `FFMPEG` (the imageio-ffmpeg binary) in the build script, or the
  render finishes and the mix fails.
- Run one renderer per storyboard at a time; two `--still` runs started together left one folder empty.
- Never `pkill -f` a pattern that also appears in your own command line: it kills your own shell.
- A sound-only change (music, a re-levelled clip) does not need a re-render: re-mix the `-nomusic` file.

## The Time Keeper end card

Every Time Keeper film ends the same way (the owner's choice, from the success story): on a near-black plate a gold
clock hand sweeps once around and draws the logo, one tick as it starts, the double tick (`tick_pair`) as the logo is
complete, then a 0.35 s fade: 3 s in all, with no banner over the logo and no black scene after it (a 1.3 s black tail
read as a broken ending). It lives in `video/brand/tk_endcard.py`; append it to the storyboard's scenes
and do not change it per film. The music ends with the story (the end card scenes carry `"endcard"`, and
`video/royal-oak/score_parts.py` writes no music under them), so the ticks are heard alone. An optional closing line
can play over it (`caption`, `voice`), as "والوقت… كان مجرد البداية." did in the success story.

## Delivery

- **Open on the cover.** WhatsApp and iMessage use the first frame as the thumbnail, and a paper film usually opens
  dark, so a shared film showed as a black box. `scripts/deliver.py film.mp4 cover.jpg film-share.mp4` holds the cover
  for 0.7 s and cross-fades into the film. It delays the audio by the same 0.7 s, so the narration and music stay in
  sync with the picture. It also attaches the cover as an `attached_pic` stream and steps the quality down until the
  file is under 29 MiB (the send limit is 30). Send that copy.
- Also send the cover as a separate JPG: Instagram and TikTok ask for the cover when you post.
- After making the share copy, check it with `ffmpeg -i`: one video, one audio and one attached picture. Then look
  at the frames at 0, 0.85 and 1.5 s.
- Commit and push the storyboard source with every version. Media stays git-ignored.

## Spending on generation

- Preflight the cost (`get_cost: true`) and tell the user what was spent.
- Test one image, then batch the rest. Redo only the image that failed, not the batch.

## Engine notes

- Inline SVGs share one id namespace: give every gradient, filter and clip a unique id (`uid()` in
  `video/royal-oak/art.py`), or the first definition wins everywhere.
- `z` must be an integer. An element has one `idle`; for a second motion use keyframes.
- A map ring that crosses 180 degrees is unwrapped (it used to draw a band across the map). A small `map` works as a
  taped inset card for routes the main map cannot hold.
